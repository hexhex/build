This directory contains basic files for building dlvhex and plugins.

To use this in your plugin, invoke

 $ cd /path/to/your/svn/branch/
 $ svn propedit svn:externals .

and add the following lines into the editor:

^/dlvhex-build/trunk/bootstrap.sh bootstrap.sh
^/dlvhex-build/trunk/doxygen.am doxygen.am
^/dlvhex-build/trunk/doxygen.cfg doxygen.cfg
^/dlvhex-build/trunk/m4/boost.m4 m4/boost.m4
^/dlvhex-build/trunk/m4/doxygen.m4 m4/doxygen.m4

Then, commit using

 $ svn ci -m "Use dlvhex-build."

and update your working directory as usual:

 $ svn up

If you get a warning like

svn: warning: The file external from 'https://dlvhex.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/dlvhex/dlvhex-build/trunk/bootstrap.sh' cannot overwrite the existing versioned item at 'bootstrap.sh'

then simply remove all pre-existing files using

 $ svn rm XXX ; svn ci -m "Remove."

and run

 $ svn up

again.
